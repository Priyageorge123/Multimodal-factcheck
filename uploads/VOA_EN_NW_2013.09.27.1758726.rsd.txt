 Obama Speaks by Phone to Iran's Rouhani President Obama and Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, have spoken by telephone, discussing efforts to resolve long-running international concerns over Iran's nuclear program. It was the first such contact in more than 30 years. Obama revealed his phone call with President Rouhani at the beginning of a previously unscheduled appearance in the White House briefing room. A senior administration official said the White House received word Friday morning that Rouhani wanted to talk with President Obama before the Iranian leader departed New York. Iran's President Hassan Rouhani speaks to journalists during a news conference in New York September 27, 2013. The administration official said the White House had also noticed President Rouhani's tweets to Obama, which expressed gratitude for his hospitality and the phone call. Even with the history of mistrust between the U.S. and Iran, Obama said, steps taken so far could offer hope for resolving the dispute over Iran's nuclear program. Iran has always denied that the program is aimed at developing a nuclear weapon. It has faced increasingly harsh economic sanctions designed to pressure it to meet international obligations. He said the United States respects the right of Iran to access peaceful nuclear energy, in the context of Iran meeting its obligations. The administration official said President Obama would engage in additional direct contacts with Rouhani if it would be helpful in resolving the Iranian nuclear issue. The official said the U.S. has been in touch with other governments about the conversation, including Israel and Gulf nations, and with members of Congress.
